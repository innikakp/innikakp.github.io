## The Power of Javascript

Learning programming languages may seem intimidating and difficult at first. However, learning gradually becomes easier after learning one language. In my case, I thought it would be challenging to learn Javascript, an unfamiliar language. Clearly, there are differences between Javascript and the other programming languages I knew, such as Java and C; yet, similarities also exist. For instance, Javascript utilizes the strict equality operator symbol (===) and its property, which is comparing two data types together, while Java and C do not. At first, I was cautious in using this symbol because it was foreign to me. Now, I’m aware of how powerful and unique this tool is, making this language even more appealing to learn.  

That being said, Javascript appears to be a decent language for beginner software engineers. It seems to be a simpler version of Java with a mixture of C++ since it shares many commonalities between the two languages. Along these lines, a benefit Javascript offers is the ability to use classes and Object Oriented Programming. OOP is a powerful tool for developers and I believe having it in Javascript would make it easier for people to create software.  



## A Perspective on Athletic Software Engineering 

Aside from learning Javascript, athletic software engineering was also a novel and unique experience for me. Essentially, athletic software engineering is a way for students to practice skills in a high-stress environment to become better software engineers. It utilizes the idea of solving coding exercises, otherwise known as “Work Out of the Day,” to train students to program and think faster and efficiently. For more information on this learning approach, please go to the [Athletic Software Engineering website] (http://philipmjohnson.org/essays/ase-2017.html).

The practice WODs, or practice “Work Out of the Day,” are practice coding problems developed to prepare students for actual WODs they would have to take in class. These practice WODs are very beneficial to students. For myself, practicing these problems helped me build an idea of what future WODs would be like. It also helped me gain more practice coding in a language I wasn’t used. There is a downside, however, which is the high stress level associated with this style of learning. Nevertheless, I believe it is to our advantageous. If taken seriously, practicing WODs will condition students to function in a fast-paced environment and to think on their feet. In theory, it’s a convenient way to help people adapt to the type of environment software engineers are used to.  

Although the idea behind the practice WODs is interesting, I would not say they are particularly enjoyable. Despite liking the concept of it, I am still not confident in my skills and ability to perform well in the WODs. It’s good for providing some sort of mental preparation before programming within a limited amount of time; however, I don’t believe this style of learning is something I would come to enjoy. Therefore, I cannot say at this time if this particular style of learning will benefit me. Despite saying this, I hope to learn valuable skills from this experience because in theory, practice is how humans learn effectively. The only way to get better at something is to practice day after day. This is a lesson I was taught time and time again and I will always put it to good use.
