## What happens in a crash

“Look out! Ship Meteor crash landing from space in 5, 4, 3, 2… ” So, what happens next? Does the fictitious ship named Meteor crash onto Earth or does it disappear to someplace outside of Earth’s atmosphere? The most probable outcome to this dilemma is... it crashes to Earth, much like how an application crashes in Meteor (yes, this is a real program). Meteor... (aids in creating applications). The feeling when an application crashes, or doesn’t function the way you want it to function, in Meteor is similar to watching a ship crash to Earth because of some sort of malfunction. To put it simply, the feeling is of *utter devastation* where (1) your soul dies a little and (2) cleaning up the remnants of this so called crash is tough, I mean really tough. I can guarantee an app crashing or not working in Meteor is something everyone has experienced and relate to. It’s so common that the worse part in an app crash is 100% trying to figure out **_how_** to fix the problem. 

## The Plain that Flies with Meteor

I’m not going to lie, Meteor is complicated. It’s also a very powerful tool, hence why it’s so complicated.  There are *many* difficulties with using Meteor, one being the large amount of time it takes to create applications within its little framework. What exactly do I mean by that? Let’s take for instance the time it takes to build an app for the very first time (essentially creating a basis of it). Unfortunately, Meteor could take, in the worst case, a hour to just make the app using its resources and in the very best (and rare at times) less than two minutes. In my case, applications would take about 10 minutes, if I get lucky. This is usually not a huge problem, however, building apps and creating the environment to run it on one’s laptop uses a lot of battery. I’m not even kidding with this. From my experience, my battery has had a battery drainage of about 20% with a fairly new laptop; it is rather scary. Not to mention, the time it takes to “index” your environment on the IDE you’re running will take *_forever_* at first! Basically, meteor is trying to make sure all the files in your directory and those that appear in your IDE are synchronized and running correctly on your host machine by indexing.
