This project was an assignment from ICS 211 (Intro to Computer Science II), Spring 2017 in which the Stack ADT was used to create a postfix calculator in Java. The calculator was text-based and asked the user to provide postfix expressions of integers, floating points, or a mixture of both. The goal of this assignment was to correctly provide the answer for the given postfix expression by creating a Calculator class. For this project, I wrote the source code for the Calculator class and the two test classes in Eclipse. The Teaching Assistant, Tyson Mook, provided us with an Exception class in order to catch any bad postfix expressions or input. Since then, I attempted to correct any errors the Teaching Assistant pointed out and made the input prompts more user-friendly. The provided image is a sample output for the given postfix expressions. 

Although this assignment seems simplistic, I learned quite a bit from this assignment alone. For one, I learned how to problem solve by figuring out what certain parts of the calculator should do and to research necessary information needed to make my program function correctly. Additionally, applying the concepts to create a useful program helped me gain a deeper understanding of how the Stack ADT worked. Thus, this simple assignment allowed me to put the knowledge I accumulated to use and to figure out what I didn't know using other resources.
