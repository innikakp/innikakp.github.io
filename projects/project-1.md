summary: A text-based postfix calculator that asked the user to enter postfix expressions consisting of integers and/or floating points. 
---

This project was an assignment from ICS 211 (Intro to Computer Science II), Spring 2017 in which the Stack ADT was used to create a postfix calculator in Java. The calculator was text-based and asked the user to provide postfix expressions of integers, floating points, or a mixture of both. The goal of this assignment was to correctly provide the answer for the given postfix expression by creating a Calculator class. 

For this project, I wrote the source code for the Calculator class and the two test classes in Eclipse. The Teaching Assistant, Tyson Mook, provided us with an Exception class in order to catch any bad postfix expressions or input. Since then, I attempted to correct any errors the Teaching Assistant pointed out and made the input prompts more user-friendly. Below is an image of a sample output of the calculator when postfix expressions are given by the user. The source code is also available at the end of this page.

Although it was simplistic, I learned many skills from this assignment alone. For one, I was able to put my problem solving skills to use by conceptually breaking the problem down into smaller parts and researching information to make my program function correctly. Additionally, applying the concepts I learned into a concrete operation helped me gain a deeper understanding of how the Stack ADT worked. Thus, this simple assignment allowed me to exercise my the knowledge I accumulated over the semester and to utilize other resources to my benefit.
