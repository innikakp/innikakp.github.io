summary: An implementation of a bank database using a linked list and text-based user interface menu in C++ developed in ICS 212.
---

The bank database was a final project in ICS 212 (Program Structures), Summer 2017. One aspect of this project was to implement a linked list of the records in the database. The information in these records contained the user's account number, name, and address. The other aspect was to create a menu of seven options which would somehow affect the linked list, such as adding to, deleting from, or reversing the record(s) in the database. Ideally, the user would be able to choose an option from the menu and that option would correspond to an action performed on the linked list (the database). 

This was a very large scaled project that required many components, such as the user-interface (the menu), and was particularly intimidating. It seemed intimidating initially because of the number of components need to function and the fact that one wrong piece/line of source code could essentially ruin the whole project. Yet, it did not seem as terrifying as I thought it would be and taught me the value of time management and being able to fully understand what is going on in the source code (or to see the code the way the CPU sees it). The course in itself has taught me many lessons that I will, hopefully, not forget, such as understanding a set of instructions given and following it to what the consumer's wishes. 

Below is a sample of the text-based output when the user wants to add a record to the database.
